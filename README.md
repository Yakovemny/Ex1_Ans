#Ex_1 Solution 
This is a Solution project for the Ex_1 assignment in Cs at Ariel University, Semester A Winter 2024 by Emanuel_y.
This project aim is to get Strings as two numbers as an input and convert them to other basis [2-16] also, to determine the representation of their multiplication result
and addition result. Furthermore the program will determine the max of the four numbers.
In this project I implemented the following methods:
-Number2Int Converts a String in the following pattern <numberpart><base><numberOfBasis> to its value in basis 10.
-Int2Number Calculate the number representation (in basis base) of the given natural number
-isNumber Checks if the given String (a) is in a valid "number" format.
-isValidBase Determines if the base is valid [2-16] (helper function in isNumber)
-isValidForBase Checks if the number part of the string is valid for the base. (helper function in isNumber)
-convert2basis10 Converts a number 'a' to its decimal representation (a helper function for Number2Int).
-isEmpty Checks if there are any 'space' characters.
-equals Checks if the two numbers have the same value.
-maxIndex search for the array index with the largest value.
