## BS"D  
## Bases calculator

**Description**  
This is a solution project for the **Ex_1 assignment** in Computer Science at Ariel University, Semester A, Winter 2024 by Emanuel_y.  
The aim of this project is to process two numbers represented as strings in various bases (2–16), convert them to other bases, and perform operations on them.  

### Implemented Methods  
- **`Number2Int`**: Converts a string in the format `<numberPart><base><numberOfBasis>` to its base-10 value.  
- **`Int2Number`**: Calculates the representation of a given natural number in a specified base.  
- **`isNumber`**: Validates if the given string follows a correct "number" format.  
- **`isValidBase`**: Verifies if the base is valid (range: 2–16). *(Helper function for `isNumber`)*  
- **`isValidForBase`**: Checks if the number part is valid for the specified base. *(Helper function for `isNumber`)*  
- **`convert2basis10`**: Converts a number to its decimal (base-10) representation. *(Helper function for `Number2Int`)*  
- **`isEmpty`**: Checks if the input contains any 'space' characters.  
- **`equals`**: Compares two numbers to check if they are equivalent in value.  
- **`maxIndex`**: Finds the index of the largest value in an array.
